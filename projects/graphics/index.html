    <p>
      I am taking CS488 (Computer Graphics) in the Summer and I want to at least
      dip my toes into graphics before diving head-in to Computer Graphics. I
      have no experience whatsoever in video game dev, 3D modelling, CAD, or any
      other graphics related technologies.
    </p>
    <h3>Things I want to do</h3>
    Based on this
    <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/1152h5v/typical_noob_graphics_programmer_question_lol/"
      >Reddit Post</a
    >, I think it's worth investigating some of these things. I've also
    taken a look at past projects of the CS488 class and their course website.
    Should definitely try some of these things before the summer term starts.

        <b>Ray Tracing</b><br />
        Write a ray-tracer from scratch to get a fundamental understanding of
        the works. Content to review: - The ray tracing in one weekend series

        Good reference but probably good to put it off for now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OpenGL</b><br>
        According to the CS488 website, <a href="https://open.gl/">open.gl</a>
        is a good starting point for learning opengl. Furthermore, the CS488
        website author said that open.gl features some good tutorials.
