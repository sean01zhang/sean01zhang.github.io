Here is a quick guide to setting up vertical tabs and removing the horizontal tab bar
in Firefox.

* Vertical Tabs
** Install Tree Style Tab
Self Explanatory. I also like having a supplementary plugin for indent lines.

** Remove Horizontal Tab Bar
This requires some more work. First, you'll need to add some CSS to
your ~userChrome.css~ file, and then you'll have to enable stylesheet
customization within Firefox.

*** User Chrome
1. Go to your profile folder. You can open this by going to ~about:support~ and find the path underneath /Profile Folder/. It should have the form ~/Users/.../Firefox/Profiles/****.default-release~.
2. Within this folder, find ~./chrome/userChrome.css~. You may have to create this file and folder if it does not exist.
3. Add the following line(s) to the file. This will always hide the tab bar.
    #+begin_src css
    #TabsToolbar { visibility: collapse !important; }
    #+end_src

*** Enable Stylesheet Customization
1. Go to ~about:config~ and proceed with caution.
2. Toggle ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ to **True**.

*** [Optional] Add title bar
If you want your traffic lights, you can enable the title bar by right-clicking
the toolbar and selecting *Customize Toolbar*. The option should
be at the bottom-right of the screen.

*** Restart Firefox
Once finished, restart Firefox.

* Conclusion
I find that removing the horizontal tab bar significantly improves this experience,
as it returns some vertical space and kills my habit of using the horiontal
tab bar instead of the vertical tab bar.
