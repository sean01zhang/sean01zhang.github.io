<h1 class="title">After Math
<br />
<span class="subtitle">My plans for Lambdus during and after my undergraduate mathematics career</span>
</h1>
<p>
In response to <code>Lynn is bad at communicating</code> sent to Sean on December 1, 2022.<br />
</p>

<p>
Hey Lynn,<br />
</p>

<p>
First of all, apologies for the late response. I read your letter right after you sent it,
but due to exams and such, I've delayed it til now. I had a partial response written up
at the start of December, but I don't think it was concise enough.
My goal with this response is to directly address the concerns you have brought up.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>Multitasking</b>
</p>

<p>
My interpretation of your original letter goes like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\neg\) <code>(alloc 100% time to Startup)</code> \(\implies\) \(\neg\) <code>(Success)</code></li>
<li><code>Sean</code> \(\implies\) \(\neg\) <code>(alloc 100% time to Startup)</code></li>
<li><code>Sean</code> \(\implies\) \(\neg\) <code>(Success)</code> , by transitivity of implies</li>
</ol>

<p>
Okay, this isn't entirely true (But its pretty funny). However, you are right that
startups need a tremendous amount of effort and focus, which I cannot provide during
school.
However, like you alluded to in your letter, I think there is a way for this project
to continue. It just requires a shift in expectations, and this is not the first time
this has happened.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Lynn's Plan</b>
</p>

<p>
When we hit our first slump, there was a shift in expectations as well. No longer were we
spending 60-70 hours on this project a week, and gone were the 12-hour calls on Discord.
Were these productive? Both of us agree that they weren't always. However, this was what it
meant for both of us putting 100% in. There was not a moment where our free time
was not dedicated to lambdus. During the slump, I took on a part time job, and you prioritized your
health (for the better, after all no Lynn = no L in Lambdus).
Did the project die because our Jira was no longer being updated? No. But in retrospect, 
those months to me felt like the most productive few months I've had on the project.   
So, I hope that I have cleared you of any guilt that there has been no "progress" recently.
</p>

<p>
Second, I understand that you want to work on yourself. And what I thought that
meant originally was that you wanted to quit Zedigo and do other things. After reading
<code>Lynn is bad at communicating</code>, I think our ideas regarding expectations moving forward
lie much closer than initially thought.
The concept is simple: You improve, and hopefully these new ideas can trickle into Lambdus
(and I purposefully said Lambdus, because not everything has to do with the animation tool, Zedigo).
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Sean's Plan</b>
</p>

<p>
And that is essentially my strategy as well. This is the reason why I believe that
staying in school is the best option. I can grow and learn difficult concepts (like
computer graphics, and networking) so that I can be qualified enough to make Lambdus
successful.
</p>

<p>
Regarding your questions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<i>How long does Sean need to work to pay off student debt?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My work terms can cover my costs, if only just barely.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>How much time can Sean reasonably put into Zedigo?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This one is difficult to answer. Work regarding zedigo moves nonlinearly,
but during my co-op terms
(which btw, I will spend more time in co-op than in school from now until graduation)
I can be very free. In person school terms are a rollercoaster of load,
so that is a lot more unpredictable, as you may have noticed.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>How can we work on Zedigo without feeling shit about how little to no progress we have?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll allude to that later.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>How big of a priority is Zedigo for Sean?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll bring it up in the next paragraph, but <b>I think Lambdus/Zedigo is the future I believe
in. I'm playing the long game for sure.</b>
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>How big of a burden would it be if I tried to call Sean every single day?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Again, depends on load. But I'm sure I can make time for you on demand.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>Would it be possible to live with Sean to increase the productivity of Zedigo?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What I've learned over the last 4 months living with others is that I
cannot live with others. If we do choose to pursue this arrangement, it will have to be
the school term after the next (which is Winter 2024), as I've already
arranged my housing for my next school term. I am open to this idea,
as I genuinely think that the University is a very good environment
to work in. It is no surprise that campus was designed for students
to do everything in.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
<i>How much emphasis does Sean need to put into academics?</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To make this absolutely clear: <b>I do not care about my grades enough to go over the top</b>.
However, I will try my best if I find the material interesting.
A question you might have is then, "Why did you pull an all-nighter for school?" My
explanation in my first draft was much longer, but I guess it was mainly due to
that one (Operating Systems) assignment being extremely important and difficult.
I even used two extension days to finish that assignment. That was the one and 
only time I pulled an all-nighter for school.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
I haven't made my personal expectations clear, and my apologies for that. At the moment,
I believe as long as we are committed to continue working together, that is okay.
For now, I will maintain Zedigo as a "Side Project" as I prioritize developing myself through
school. You might have the question, when does this whole thing become not a side project?
And to that, I do not know. For now, I'll say: whenever I can financially sustain
myself from doing what I love is when I will choose to make Lambdus/Zedigo my main job.
</p>

<p>
Does this mean I'm doing start-ups for the money? No. I simply need to live comfortably.
My belief is that the most rewarding experience is when I can learn and grow.
Maybe I can be proven wrong, but I think there are limited amounts of those kinds of
experiences in the conventional job market. Thus, my belief is that even if I tried to
go all-in somewhere else, I would ultimately still end up at Lambdus.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't answer how much time I can put into Zedigo now and into the future. I think
there will be many opportunities to even periodically take time off to work on Zedigo
(this is after graduation, as for now I want to focus on school). For now, personal improvement
will be my primary priority, and I have no immediate plans regarding work on <code>zedigo-frontend</code>.
I want to assure you that even though I call it a "side" project, it is not sidelined in
my list of priorities.
</p>

<p>
I know you're quite concerned about what happens beyond my undergraduate career. I cannot
predict the future, but what I expect is that I can graduate debt free and can find a relatively
stable job to survive. The rest is a blank page waiting to be filled in.
It will be very similar to how my co-op terms will feel, I think.
</p></li>

<li><p>
\(\neg\) <b>Zedigo Plans</b>
</p>

<p>
However, all of what I wrote doesn't cover the personal relationship between me and you moving
forward. I agree that there has been an overt focus on Zedigo, which has sidelined the more
personal discussions between us.
</p>

<p>
This feels all too similar to the latter part of 2017, where our discussions were
ninety-percent about anime and ten-percent about school. Once you quit school, and
took a break from the binge of anime, I realized that we had not much to talk about anymore.
</p>

<p>
Moving forward, I think we can try a few things.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A quick existence check every once in a while
was what bridged the drought in communication up until Lambdus. We can share what we've
been doing, learning, and hopefully that can be inspiring to the both of us.
This doesn't need to be forced. Whenever you feel like you have something interesting
to share or want to talk, that's a perfect time to do so. Again, no obligations or
anything. Just pop a message whenever you feel like it.</li>
<li>I honestly thought I had more ideas, but it seems like I've come up short. If we
ever get to room together in Waterloo, that will be interesting for sure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
I think most misunderstandings have been cleared, and I hope we both understand where our
intentions lie with regards to Lambdus/Zedigo for the immediate future. I might document
some of my other thoughts and updates in another letter maybe later, or whenever we talk
again.<br />
</p>

<p>
I intend Lambdus to keep existing until one of us decides that
it no longer does. Lambdus is essentially the embodiment of our collaborative effort
to try and do something. Lambdus predated Zedigo, and will also live beyond Zedigo.
As long as this collaboration exists, Lambdus is not disappearing. <br />
