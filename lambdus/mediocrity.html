	 <h2>
	Thoughts on Me(diocrity) and the Future of Lambdus
	 </h2>
<p>
In response to a message sent to Sean from Lynn on November 28, 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Hello Lynn,
<br/>
<br/>
I see that my lack of recent commitment is unacceptable for you.
In particular, I understand that you are not okay with
my inconsistency/amount of contribution to Zedigo.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding my decision, I will choose to stay in school. From what I interpret
from the letter, this means that you will stop working on Zedigo, so I will 
retire the infrastructure. I will no longer
renew the Lambdus domain when it comes time to in February. The Github organization will
be kept as-is unless specifically requested otherwise.
The joint Twitch and Youtube account will be left as-is, unless requested that it be
taken down by either of us.
<br/>
<br/>
After working with you for a long time, I foresaw this message coming.
Even though I completely knew what was coming, I am still lost for words as to what
to say. I feel like I stuck faithfully (only declaring times of break periodically)
to this project throughout the ups and downs, but if you do not feel that things
can continue on like this, so be it. From your message, I realize this means
that we will not be talking for a while and I can't help but feel a bit sad to
hear that I will no longer be a part of the people you talk to. However, I admit
that we do not share much in common anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
My response is not much of a proposal but a shallow reaction,
as I think it would be improper of me to not acknowledge the thought you put
into writing your message to me. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for wasting your time, and good luck on your future endeavours. 
I'm rooting for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Farewell, <br/>
Sean
